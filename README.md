The swiping gesture to get to the edit and delete buttons are replaced with a click. You can click anywhere within thefirst habit box on /list.html EXCEPT the thumbs up (which lets you view your progress) and the thumbs down (which does nothing).   

We decided to add a header to the habits page to keep the look of pages more consistent, and to give the viewer an idea of what they are looking at.

We also added a "View Your Habits" button to the landing page to take a user directly to their habits without going into adding a habit.
